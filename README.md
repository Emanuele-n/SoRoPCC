SoRoPCC is the MATLAB toolbox based on the Piecewise-Constant-Curvature modelling of soft robots. 
It allows you to simulate and control a customizable soft manipulator, both for Shape Control and for Task-space Control, either by controlling the curvature of each CC segment or the position and orientation of the tip of the robot.
